# Setup
It is recommended that you install the required libraries in a virtual environment such as [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

To follow with this setup, create an environment called ```testing``` by running.
```
virtualenv testing
```

Now using the startup script will activate your environment and ensure that the dependencies are installed.

```
source setup.sh
```
